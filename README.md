drop
====

First game I built using Libgdx framework. I followed the tutorial here https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game ,
I  have also added movement across Y-axis along with increase in game speed as you catch the droplets the speed increases. Warning game is very difficult after catching two droplets.
